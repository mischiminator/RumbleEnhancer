# RumbleEnhancer
Rumble enhancement plugin for Beat Saber.

A couple months ago, a Beat Saber update reduced the vibration/rumble intensity for what seems to be better controller battery life. However, ever since that change, cutting cubes did not feel the same without the strong haptic feedback.
With my first mod, I decided to try and get that feeling back, and the result is this Rumble Enhancing plugin:

Place the dll in the Plugins folder, launch a song, and enjoy!

You will find the Settings in the game settings and in the modprefs.ini file
